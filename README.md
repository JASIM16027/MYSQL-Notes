# MYSQL-Notes

## What are the differences between **SQL** and **NoSQL** databases? When would you choose one over the other?
  
---

### **1. SQL Databases**

#### **Key Features**
- **Structured Data**: Data is stored in predefined rows and columns.
- **Relationships**: SQL databases enforce relationships through foreign keys.
- **Schema-Driven**: You must define the schema upfront, meaning you know the structure of the data ahead of time.
- **Strong Consistency (ACID)**: Transactions in SQL databases guarantee **Atomicity**, **Consistency**, **Isolation**, and **Durability**.

#### **Common Examples of SQL Databases**
- **MySQL**: Open-source, widely used for web applications.
- **PostgreSQL**: Supports advanced features like JSON, full-text search, and custom extensions.
- **Oracle Database**: Enterprise-grade SQL database with high scalability and support.
- **Microsoft SQL Server**: Microsoft’s robust relational database with integration into the .NET ecosystem.

#### **Example Scenario: Banking System**
A banking application requires:
1. Strict data integrity.
2. Complex relationships like customers, accounts, and transactions.
3. ACID-compliant transactions to ensure financial accuracy.

**Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  email VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE accounts (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INT,
  balance DECIMAL(10, 2),
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id)
);

CREATE TABLE transactions (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  account_id INT,
  amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
  type ENUM('debit', 'credit'),
  transaction_date DATETIME,
  FOREIGN KEY (account_id) REFERENCES accounts(id)
);
```

**SQL Query Example:**
```sql
SELECT c.name, a.balance, t.type, t.amount
FROM customers c
JOIN accounts a ON c.id = a.customer_id
JOIN transactions t ON a.id = t.account_id
WHERE c.id = 1;
```

---

### **2. NoSQL Databases**

#### **Key Features**
- **Flexible Schema**: Data can be added without strictly defined schemas, allowing for unstructured or semi-structured data.
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Data is distributed across multiple servers, making it ideal for handling massive workloads.
- **High Availability**: NoSQL databases prioritize availability (eventual consistency) in distributed systems.
- **Optimized for Specific Use Cases**:
  - Document Stores (e.g., MongoDB): JSON-like documents.
  - Key-Value Stores (e.g., Redis): Simple key-value pairs.
  - Column Stores (e.g., Cassandra): Data stored in columns for analytics.
  - Graph Databases (e.g., Neo4j): Nodes and edges for relationship-heavy use cases.

#### **Common Examples of NoSQL Databases**
- **MongoDB**: Flexible document-based database, great for dynamic schemas.
- **Cassandra**: Distributed database for high availability and scalability.
- **Redis**: In-memory key-value store for caching and real-time use cases.
- **Neo4j**: Optimized for graph-based data and relationship queries.

#### **Example Scenario: E-commerce Product Catalog**
An e-commerce platform needs:
1. Flexible product schemas (e.g., some products have different attributes like color, size, or specs).
2. High write-read throughput for handling customer searches and updates.

**MongoDB Document Example:**
```json
{
  "_id": "p123",
  "name": "Laptop",
  "brand": "TechBrand",
  "price": 1200,
  "specifications": {
    "CPU": "Intel i7",
    "RAM": "16GB",
    "Storage": "512GB SSD"
  },
  "categories": ["electronics", "laptops"],
  "ratings": {
    "average": 4.5,
    "reviews": 125
  }
}
```

**MongoDB Query Example:**
```javascript
// Find laptops by brand and filter by price
db.products.find({
  brand: "TechBrand",
  price: { $lt: 1500 }
});
```

---

### **3. ACID vs BASE**

To understand **ACID** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), let's break it down with a **real-world calculation example**: a bank fund transfer system where we transfer money between two accounts.

---

### **Scenario**: Transferring $100 from Account A to Account B

- **Initial Balances**:
  - Account A: $500
  - Account B: $300

- **Goal**:
  Transfer $100 from Account A to Account B.

---

### **1. Atomicity**

Atomicity ensures that a transaction is **all or nothing**. Either both the debit and credit operations happen, or neither happens.

#### Steps:
- Debit $100 from Account A → $500 - $100 = $400
- Credit $100 to Account B → $300 + $100 = $400

#### What Happens If Atomicity Fails?
- Debit occurs, but credit fails (e.g., system crash after debiting Account A):
  - Account A: $400
  - Account B: $300
  - Total: $700 (Incorrect!)
  
  Atomicity ensures that **both operations succeed or none are applied**, maintaining the integrity of the transaction.

---

### **2. Consistency**

Consistency ensures that the **database remains in a valid state** before and after the transaction, adhering to predefined rules.

#### Rules:
- Total money in the system must remain the same.
- Before: $500 (A) + $300 (B) = $800
- After: $400 (A) + $400 (B) = $800 (Valid!)

#### What Happens If Consistency Fails?
- If $100 is debited from Account A but not credited to Account B:
  - Account A: $400
  - Account B: $300
  - Total: $700 (Violates consistency!)

Consistency ensures the system remains **logically correct** after every transaction.

---

### **3. Isolation**

Isolation ensures that **concurrent transactions do not interfere** with each other. Let's say:

#### Two Transactions Run Simultaneously:
1. **T1**: Transfer $100 from A to B
2. **T2**: Transfer $200 from A to C

- Without Isolation:
  - T1 debits $100 from A (new balance $400).
  - T2 reads the outdated balance of $500 and debits $200 → Result: $300 in Account A.
  - Total debits: $300 instead of $100 + $200 = $300. This is **wrong**.

- With Isolation:
  - T1 completes first:
    - Account A: $400
  - Then T2 starts:
    - Account A: $400 - $200 = $200
  - Correct result.

Isolation ensures transactions are processed **serially or in a way that doesn’t conflict**.

---

### **4. Durability**

Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, its changes are **permanent**, even in case of system failure.

#### Steps:
1. Debit $100 from A.
2. Credit $100 to B.
3. Commit the transaction.

- What Happens If Durability Fails?
  - The system crashes after committing the transaction.
  - On recovery:
    - Account A: $400
    - Account B: $400
    - Durability ensures these changes are saved to disk and remain intact.

If durability is not ensured, data may revert to the previous state ($500 and $300), losing the transaction.

---

### Code Example: ACID in Action with TypeORM

Here’s how ACID principles apply in a Node.js app using TypeORM:

```typescript
import { AppDataSource } from './data-source';

async function transferFunds(senderId: number, receiverId: number, amount: number) {
  const queryRunner = AppDataSource.createQueryRunner();
  await queryRunner.connect();
  await queryRunner.startTransaction();

  try {
    // Atomicity: Both debit and credit must succeed
    const sender = await queryRunner.manager.findOne('Account', { where: { id: senderId } });
    const receiver = await queryRunner.manager.findOne('Account', { where: { id: receiverId } });

    if (!sender || !receiver) throw new Error('Account not found');
    if (sender.balance < amount) throw new Error('Insufficient funds');

    // Debit sender
    sender.balance -= amount;
    await queryRunner.manager.save(sender);

    // Credit receiver
    receiver.balance += amount;
    await queryRunner.manager.save(receiver);

    // Commit transaction
    await queryRunner.commitTransaction(); // Ensures Durability
    console.log('Transaction successful');
  } catch (error) {
    // Rollback if any operation fails (Atomicity)
    await queryRunner.rollbackTransaction();
    console.error('Transaction failed:', error.message);
  } finally {
    await queryRunner.release(); // Ensures proper cleanup
  }
}

transferFunds(1, 2, 100);
```

---

### Explanation of Code:

1. **Atomicity**: 
   - Debit and credit are executed within a single transaction.
   - If one fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.

2. **Consistency**:
   - Ensures the total balance across accounts remains unchanged.

3. **Isolation**:
   - The transaction runs in isolation using the query runner, avoiding interference with other transactions.

4. **Durability**:
   - Once the transaction commits, changes are persisted to the database, even if the application crashes afterward.

| **Feature**               | **SQL (ACID)**                                                                                          | **NoSQL (BASE)**                                                                                         |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Atomicity**             | Ensures all steps in a transaction are completed; if not, none are executed.                           | Transactions may be incomplete; eventual consistency is prioritized.                                   |
| **Consistency**           | Ensures the database remains in a valid state after a transaction.                                     | Data may temporarily violate consistency but becomes consistent over time.                             |
| **Isolation**             | Transactions do not interfere with one another.                                                       | High availability is prioritized over isolation.                                                       |
| **Durability**            | Changes persist, even in case of failure.                                                             | Durability may depend on replication and backups rather than immediate writes.                         |
| **Performance**           | More predictable but can be slower due to transaction overhead.                                       | Optimized for performance, especially in distributed environments.                                     |

### **6. Example Real-World Applications**
#### **SQL Example: Uber Rides**
Uber uses PostgreSQL for relational data like:
- User profiles.
- Payment details.
- Trip records with precise consistency needs.

#### **NoSQL Example: Netflix Streaming**
Netflix uses Cassandra for:
- Tracking real-time data (e.g., user views, recommendations).
- Storing billions of events per day, where eventual consistency is acceptable.

---

### **Conclusion**
- Choose **SQL** when your application needs structured data, strong consistency, and complex queries.
- Choose **NoSQL** when you need flexibility, high scalability, and high availability, particularly for unstructured or distributed systems.





## Transaction States in DBMS

A transaction is a series of operations or tasks that work together to complete a specific process, which may involve changing data in a database. To handle issues like system failures, transactions go through different states.

A transaction state shows the current stage or condition of a transaction as it runs in the database. It tracks the progress and determines whether the transaction will finish successfully (commit) or stop due to an issue (abort).

## Different Types of Transaction States in DBMS

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e0ce364-5934-49b6-9d89-8d079975aae9)

### Simplified Explanation of Transaction States

1. **Active State**  
   - The transaction starts, and its instructions (like insert, update, delete) are being executed.  
   - Changes are not yet saved to the database but kept temporarily in memory.

2. **Partially Committed**  
   - The transaction finishes all its operations but hasn't saved the changes permanently to the database yet.  
   - If successful, it moves to the "Committed" state; if something fails, it moves to the "Failed" state.

3. **Failed State**  
   - If an error occurs during the transaction, it stops, and the system ensures the database remains consistent.  
   - The database recovery system may attempt to fix the issue or terminate the transaction.

4. **Aborted State**  
   - If recovery from the failed state isn’t possible, the transaction is rolled back (undone) to restore the database to its original state.  
   - The transaction may either be canceled or restarted.

5. **Committed State**  
   - The transaction successfully saves its changes permanently to the database.  
   - This marks the completion of the transaction.

6. **Terminated State**  
   - After committing or rolling back, the transaction ends, and the system is ready for a new transaction.

---

### Example: Bank Transaction ($500 transfer from Account A to Account B)
1. **Active State:**  
   The transaction starts and reads Account A’s balance ($1000). It checks if there are sufficient funds.  

2. **Partially Committed:**  
   Deducts $500 from Account A ($1000 - $500 = $500) and temporarily updates Account B’s balance ($1500).

3. **Committed:**  
   Changes are saved permanently:  
   - Account A = $500  
   - Account B = $1500  

4. **Failed State:**  
   If something goes wrong (e.g., system crash), the transaction stops.  
   - Example: $500 is deducted from Account A but not added to Account B.

5. **Aborted State:**  
   The failed transaction is rolled back:  
   - Account A = $1000  
   - Account B = $1000  

6. **Terminated State:**  
   The transaction ends after committing or rolling back. The system is ready for a new transaction.  

This process ensures the database remains consistent, either completing the transaction fully or undoing changes in case of failure.



### What is Second Normal Form (2NF)?

Second Normal Form (2NF) is a step in database normalization that ensures the elimination of partial dependencies, which occur when non-key columns depend on only part of a composite primary key. 

To achieve 2NF, two rules must be satisfied:
1. **Be in 1NF**: The table must have a primary key, and all values must be atomic (no repeating groups or arrays).
2. **No Partial Dependencies**: All non-key columns must depend on the **entire primary key**, not just a part of it.

- **Primary Key**: Composite key `(MembershipID, MovieRented)` uniquely identifies each row.
- Issue: Non-key column `MemberName` depends only on `MembershipID`, not the entire composite key. This is a **partial dependency**.

---

#### Why Is This Not in 2NF?

- `MemberName` depends **only on MembershipID** (part of the composite key).
- `MovieRented` and `RentalDate` depend on the entire composite key `(MembershipID, MovieRented)`.

This violates 2NF because not all non-key columns depend on the entire primary key.

---

#### Moving to 2NF: Splitting the Table

To remove the partial dependency, divide the table into two:

1. **Table 1: Members**
   | MembershipID | MemberName |
   |--------------|------------|
   | 101          | John Doe   |
   | 102          | Jane Roe   |

   - **Primary Key**: `MembershipID`
   - `MemberName` depends only on `MembershipID`.

2. **Table 2: Rentals**
   | MembershipID | MovieRented | RentalDate |
   |--------------|-------------|------------|
   | 101          | Matrix      | 2025-01-15 |
   | 101          | Inception   | 2025-01-16 |
   | 102          | Avatar      | 2025-01-15 |

   - **Primary Key**: Composite key `(MembershipID, MovieRented)`
   - `RentalDate` depends on the entire composite key.

---

### Foreign Key and Its Role

- In **Table 2**, `MembershipID` is now a **foreign key** that links back to **Table 1**.
- A **foreign key**:
  1. References the **primary key** of another table (here, `MembershipID` in **Table 1**).
  2. Helps establish relationships between tables (connects members to their rentals).
  3. Allows rows in one table to correspond to rows in another.

---

### Key Points About Foreign Keys
- A **foreign key** can have a name different from the primary key it references.
- **Foreign keys do not need to be unique**, as multiple rows in the child table can reference the same row in the parent table.
- Unlike primary keys, **foreign keys can contain NULL values**, meaning the reference can be optional.

---

### Benefits of 2NF and Foreign Keys
- Eliminates **partial dependencies**, reducing data redundancy.
- Organizes data into separate, related tables, improving database consistency.
- **Foreign keys** ensure relationships between tables remain valid, supporting data integrity.

### What is a Transitive Functional Dependency?

A **transitive functional dependency** happens when a non-key column in a database table indirectly depends on the primary key **through another non-key column**.

### Breaking It Down:

1. A **functional dependency** means one column's value determines another column's value.  
   Example: In a `Students` table, `StudentID → Name` means the `StudentID` determines the `Name`.

2. **Transitive dependency** means this happens indirectly.  
   - Column A (Primary Key) determines Column B.  
   - Column B determines Column C.  
   - Therefore, Column A indirectly determines Column C.  

This indirect dependency is a **transitive functional dependency**.

---

### Example:

Consider a `Students` table:

| StudentID | DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| 101       | D01          | Computer Science |
| 102       | D02          | Mathematics      |

- **Primary Key**: `StudentID`  
- **Functional Dependency**:  
  - `StudentID → DepartmentID` (StudentID determines DepartmentID).  
  - `DepartmentID → DepartmentName` (DepartmentID determines DepartmentName).  
  - So, `StudentID → DepartmentName` is a transitive dependency because `StudentID` indirectly determines `DepartmentName` through `DepartmentID`.

---

#### Why Is This a Problem?
- Transitive dependencies can lead to **data redundancy** and **anomalies**.  
- Example: If the department name changes, you must update it everywhere it appears in the table.


#### Solution:

- **Normalize the table** to eliminate transitive dependencies by creating separate tables for related data.  
- For the example, split the table into two:  
  1. **Students Table**: `StudentID`, `DepartmentID`  
  2. **Departments Table**: `DepartmentID`, `DepartmentName`  

This ensures data consistency and avoids redundancy.


## What is an **index**, and how does it improve performance? What are the downsides of over-indexing?

### **What is an Index?**

An **index** in a database is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table at the cost of additional storage and write performance. It works similarly to an index in a book, where you can quickly locate a topic without scanning every page. Indexes are created on columns in a database table to enable faster lookups for specific queries.

#### **How Does an Index Work?**

Indexes typically use data structures like:
- **B-trees**: Used by most relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for range queries and ordered data.
- **Hash tables**: Used for exact match lookups (e.g., some NoSQL databases like MongoDB for specific indexes).
- **Bitmap indexes**: Used for columns with low cardinality (e.g., gender, status).
- **Inverted indexes**: Common in full-text search engines (e.g., Elasticsearch).

When you query a table, the database checks if an appropriate index exists:
- If an index is available, the database performs a **direct lookup** instead of scanning the entire table.
- If no index exists, the database performs a **full table scan**, which is slower for large datasets.

---

### **Types of Indexes**

1. **Primary Index**: Automatically created on the primary key column(s) of a table.
2. **Unique Index**: Ensures no duplicate values in the indexed column(s).
3. **Composite Index**: Created on multiple columns to optimize queries involving those columns.
4. **Clustered Index**: Determines the physical storage order of data in a table (e.g., used in SQL Server).
5. **Non-Clustered Index**: Separate from the table data; contains pointers to the actual data.
6. **Full-Text Index**: Optimized for searching text-based data (e.g., searching keywords within a document).

---

### **How Does an Index Improve Performance?**

1. **Speeds Up Data Retrieval**:
   - Instead of scanning every row in the table (full table scan), the database uses the index to directly locate the relevant rows.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM employees WHERE last_name = 'Smith';
     ```
     If an index exists on the `last_name` column, the query engine uses it to fetch results faster.

2. **Optimizes Search Operations**:
   - Indexes are ideal for queries with conditions like `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `LIMIT`, and `JOIN`.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-01-10';
     ```

3. **Improves Sorting and Aggregation**:
   - Sorting and grouping operations are faster because indexes are often stored in an ordered manner.

4. **Enables Quick Joins**:
   - Indexes on foreign keys improve join performance significantly.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT * 
     FROM orders 
     JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id;
     ```

---

### **Downsides of Over-Indexing**

While indexes improve read performance, over-indexing can introduce significant drawbacks:

#### **1. Increased Storage Requirements**
- Each index consumes additional disk space.
- Example: If you have 5 indexes on a table with millions of rows, the index files can grow significantly, impacting storage costs.

#### **2. Slower Write Performance**
- **Insert, Update, and Delete operations** become slower because the database needs to update all relevant indexes.
- Example: Adding a row to a table with multiple indexes requires the database to update the index structure for each indexed column.

#### **3. Maintenance Overhead**
- Indexes require maintenance, especially during bulk inserts or schema migrations.
- Fragmentation can occur over time, requiring reindexing for optimal performance.

#### **4. Query Optimization Pitfalls**
- If too many indexes exist, the query optimizer may choose a suboptimal index, resulting in inefficient query execution.

#### **5. Diminishing Returns for Low-Cardinality Columns**
- Indexes on low-cardinality columns (e.g., gender, boolean flags) are less effective because they don’t significantly reduce the number of rows scanned.
- Example: An index on a column with only two distinct values (`true/false`) is unlikely to improve performance.

#### **6. Risk of Redundant Indexes**
- Creating overlapping or redundant indexes can lead to unnecessary storage and maintenance overhead.
- Example:
  - Index 1: `(col1)`
  - Index 2: `(col1, col2)`
  - In many cases, Index 2 can cover queries optimized by Index 1, making Index 1 redundant.

---

### **Best Practices for Indexing**

1. **Use Indexes Strategically**:
   - Create indexes on columns frequently used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`, or `GROUP BY` clauses.
   - Avoid indexing columns that are rarely queried or have low cardinality.

2. **Monitor Index Usage**:
   - Use tools like `EXPLAIN` (MySQL/PostgreSQL) or `EXPLAIN PLAN` (Oracle) to analyze query execution plans and determine which indexes are being used.
   - Identify unused indexes and drop them.

3. **Limit Composite Indexes**:
   - Only create composite indexes for queries that filter by multiple columns.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 5 AND order_date = '2025-01-10';
     ```
     A composite index on `(customer_id, order_date)` is more efficient than separate indexes.

4. **Rebuild and Reorganize Indexes**:
   - Periodically rebuild or reorganize indexes to prevent fragmentation in write-heavy workloads.

5. **Use Covering Indexes**:
   - Include all columns needed for the query in the index to avoid extra lookups.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_date ON orders (customer_id, order_date, total_amount);
     ```

6. **Balance Read and Write Needs**:
   - Consider the trade-offs between read and write performance when designing indexes for write-heavy systems.

---

### **Example of Over-Indexing Impact**

#### **Scenario**:
A table `orders` has:
- 1 million rows.
- Columns: `id`, `customer_id`, `order_date`, `total_amount`.

#### **Indexes**:
- Index 1: `customer_id`
- Index 2: `order_date`
- Index 3: `total_amount`

#### **Impact**:
1. **Inserts**: Every time a new order is inserted, all three indexes need to be updated.
   - This increases the time required for each insert operation.
2. **Storage**: Each index takes additional space, significantly increasing storage requirements.
3. **Query Optimization Confusion**: If a query like this is run:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date = '2025-01-10' AND total_amount > 1000;
   ```
   The query optimizer might choose an index suboptimally, resulting in slower performance.

#### **Solution**:
- Replace multiple single-column indexes with a composite index:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_orders_date_amount ON orders (order_date, total_amount);
  ```

---

### **Conclusion**

Indexes are powerful tools for improving database performance, especially for read-heavy workloads. However, excessive or improper indexing can lead to increased storage, slower writes, and maintenance challenges. The key is to strike a balance between **read performance**, **write performance**, and **storage costs** by carefully analyzing query patterns and monitoring index usage.

  +---------------------------------------------+
```


The image explains how table data is actually stored in a database, emphasizing that the typical tabular representation of rows and columns is just a **logical view** and not how data is physically stored.

### Key points:
1. **Logical Representation**: 
   - The table with columns like `Emp ID`, `Name`, and `Address` is a conceptual way to view the data.
   - The actual data is not stored tabular form in the database's physical storage.

2. **Data Pages**: 
   - Databases use **data pages** to store information. 
   - A data page typically has a size of **8KB**, though this can vary depending on the database system.
   
3. **Multiple Rows in a Page**: 
   - Each **data page** can store multiple rows of a table, meaning the physical storage is organized into these data pages, and the rows are spread across them.

 ### **Data Pages**:
 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df5d8c3e-304d-470c-ab3b-a8d835c34007)

This image shows the structure of a **data page** in a database system, breaking down how the 8KB (8192 bytes) of storage in a data page is divided.

Here’s a text-based diagram to represent the structure of the data page shown in the image:

```
+-------------------------------+
|         Data Page (8KB)        |
|          (8192 bytes)          |
+-------------------------------+
|                               |
|  Header (96 bytes)            |
|  - PageNo                     |
|  - Free space                 |
|  - Checksum, etc.             |
|                               |
+-------------------------------+
|                               |
|  Data Records (8060 bytes)    |
|  - Actual data is stored here |
|                               |
+-------------------------------+
|                               |
|  Offset (36 bytes)            |
|  - Array of pointers to       |
|    corresponding data         |
|                               |
+-------------------------------+
```

### Breakdown of a Data Page:
1. **Header (96 bytes)**:
   - Stores metadata about the page such as:
     - **PageNo**: The page number that identifies this specific page.
     - **Free space**: The amount of free space available in the page.
     - **Checksum**: Used for data integrity checks.

2. **Data Records (8060 bytes)**:
   - This section is where the **actual data** is stored.
   - Most of the page is used to hold rows from the table.

3. **Offset (36 bytes)**:
   - Contains an array of pointers.
   - Each index in this array points to a corresponding data record in the "Data Records" section.
   - This helps locate the specific data within the page.

### Summary:
The **8KB page** is divided into these three components:
- **96 bytes** for the **header** to store metadata.
- **8060 bytes** for **data records** to store actual row data.
- **36 bytes** for the **offset array** that holds pointers to the data. 

This structure helps the DBMS efficiently manage and retrieve data.


##  **Data pages** and **Data blocks**

The relationship between **data pages** and **data blocks** in a database system, focusing on how data is stored and managed in physical memory.

"Remember, DBMS controls data pages (like what row goes in which page or sequence of pages, etc.) but  **DBMS has no control over Data Blocks** (data blocks can be scattered over the disk)."
 **Data Pages** are logical units of data storage within the DBMS, while **Data Blocks** are the physical units of storage at the disk level.

### Key points:
1. **DBMS and Data Pages**:
   - The **DBMS (Database Management System)** creates and manages multiple **data pages** to store the data of a table.
   - A table's data can span across many data pages, depending on its size.

2. **Data Pages Stored in Data Blocks**:
   - These **data pages** are ultimately stored in **data blocks**, which reside in **physical memory** (such as a disk).
   - A **data block** is the smallest unit of data storage that can be read or written during an input/output (I/O) operation.

### What is a Data Block?
- **Data Block**: The minimum amount of data that can be transferred to and from disk during I/O operations.
- **Managed by Disk**: The data block is controlled by the underlying storage system (such as a hard drive or SSD).
- **Size Range**: Data block sizes can vary, typically ranging from **4KB to 32KB**. A common size is **8KB**.
- **Multiple Data Pages**: Depending on the block size, a data block can contain **one or more data pages**.

### Summary:
The DBMS manages data by creating **data pages**, which are logically organized but stored in **data blocks** in physical storage. The **data block** is the smallest unit of data that the storage system reads or writes, and depending on its size, it may hold multiple data pages.


The image explains the concept of a **Data Block** in the context of database management systems (DBMS) and disk storage. Here's a detailed breakdown of the information:

### What is a Data Block?
- **Data Block** is the minimum amount of data that can be read from or written to disk in a single I/O (input/output) operation. In essence, it is the smallest unit of storage that can be addressed by a storage system like a disk.
  
### Key Points:
1. **Managed by the Storage System (like a disk)**: The data block size is controlled by the storage system, which can be a disk, SSD, or any underlying hardware.
   
2. **Block Size Range**: 
   - Data block sizes generally range between **4KB to 32KB**. 
   - A common size for many systems is **8KB**. 
   - This size is crucial because it affects the performance and storage efficiency. Larger block sizes may be more efficient for reading and writing large files, while smaller block sizes might suit systems with many small files.

3. **Relationship Between Data Block and Data Page**: 
   - A **Data Page** is a unit of data management inside the DBMS. Depending on the block size, a single block can hold **one or multiple data pages**.
   - For example, if the block size is 8KB and the data page is 4KB, one block can store two pages. If the block size matches the page size (both 8KB), one block will hold exactly one page.

### Mapping Between Data Page and Data Block:
- The DBMS (Database Management System) maintains a **mapping** between data pages and data blocks. 
   - In this mapping, each data page (logical data structure) is stored inside a data block (physical storage unit).
   - The diagram suggests that multiple data pages can be mapped to a single data block. For instance:
     - **Data Page 1 and Data Page 2** both map to **Data Block 1**. 
     - This could imply that two data pages share the same physical data block (due to the block’s size).
This illustrates the idea that depending on the size of data pages and blocks, one block can store one or many pages.

```
  ---------------------------------
  |        Data Block 1           |
  ---------------------------------
  | Data Page 1 | Data Page 2     |  -> One block contains two pages.
  ---------------------------------

  ---------------------------------
  |        Data Block 2           |
  ---------------------------------
  | Data Page 3                   |  -> This block contains one page (large enough to fill the block).
  ---------------------------------

  ---------------------------------
  |        Data Block 3           |
  ---------------------------------
  | Data Page 4 | Data Page 5     |  -> Another block with two pages.
  ---------------------------------

  ---------------------------------
  |        Data Block 4           |
  ---------------------------------
  | Data Page 6 | Data Page 7     |  -> Similar structure with two pages.
  ---------------------------------

  ---------------------------------
  |        Data Block 5           |
  ---------------------------------
  | Data Page 8                   |  -> Block fully occupied by one large page.
  ---------------------------------
```

### Explanation:
- **Data Block 1** holds two smaller pages: `Data Page 1` and `Data Page 2`.
- **Data Block 2** holds a single, larger page: `Data Page 3`.
- **Data Blocks 3 and 4** both hold two pages each, showing how multiple pages can fit into one block when they are smaller than the block size.
- **Data Block 5** is similar to Block 2, where one larger page (`Data Page 8`) occupies the entire block.



### Why It Matters:
- The relationship between data blocks and data pages is crucial in terms of performance and storage management.
  - **I/O performance**: The size of a data block impacts how efficiently data is read from or written to disk. Larger blocks can reduce the number of I/O operations required to access large files, while smaller blocks can optimize small-file access.
  - **Fragmentation and space management**: If data block sizes are too large, storage can be wasted, especially for systems dealing with small files. On the other hand, too-small blocks may increase overhead.

In DBMS, this mapping also influences how data retrieval and modification operations are performed, as the DBMS needs to read data blocks and map them back to logical pages. The more optimized this process is, the better the overall performance.



## Explain the difference between **pessimistic locking** and **optimistic locking**.

Pessimistic locking and optimistic locking are strategies used in database management to handle **concurrent data access** and ensure **data integrity** when multiple users or processes interact with the same dataset at the same time. The right choice between these two approaches depends on the specific use case, system design, and level of contention in the environment.

---

### **1. What is Pessimistic Locking?**

#### **Definition:**
Pessimistic locking assumes that conflicts between concurrent transactions **are likely to occur**. It prevents these conflicts by locking the data immediately when it is accessed, ensuring that only one transaction can work on it at a time.

---

#### **How It Works:**
- When a transaction accesses a piece of data, it locks the record (shared or exclusive lock).
- Other transactions attempting to access the same record must either:
  - Wait until the lock is released.
  - Fail if they cannot acquire the lock in time.

---

#### **Example Use Case:**
Imagine two processes trying to update an inventory table:
1. **Transaction 1:**
   ```sql
   BEGIN TRANSACTION;
   SELECT * FROM Inventory WHERE ProductID = 101 FOR UPDATE;
   ```
   - Locks the row with `ProductID = 101`, preventing other updates.

2. **Transaction 2:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Inventory WHERE ProductID = 101 FOR UPDATE;
   ```
   - This query is **blocked** until Transaction 1 releases the lock.

---

#### **Advantages of Pessimistic Locking:**

1. **Data Integrity Guaranteed:** Conflicts are avoided as only one transaction can modify the data at a time.
2. **No Need for Conflict Detection:** Since conflicts are prevented, there’s no need to check for version changes.
3. Ideal for **high-risk systems**, such as:
   - Banking systems (e.g., transferring money).
   - Real-time inventory systems.

---

#### **Disadvantages of Pessimistic Locking:**

1. **Performance Bottlenecks:** Other transactions must wait, reducing concurrency.
2. **Deadlocks:** Two or more transactions can block each other indefinitely while waiting for locks.
3. **Overhead:** Managing locks increases resource usage and slows down the system in high-traffic scenarios.

---

---

### **2. What is Optimistic Locking?**

#### **Definition:**
Optimistic locking assumes that conflicts are **rare** and allows transactions to proceed without locking the data. Instead, it verifies at the time of committing changes whether another transaction has modified the data.

---

#### **How It Works:**
1. Each data record has a **version identifier** (e.g., a version number or timestamp).
2. A transaction reads the data along with its version.
3. Before committing updates:
   - The transaction checks whether the version is the same as it was when the data was first read.
   - If the version is unchanged, the update proceeds, and the version is incremented.
   - If the version has changed, the transaction fails and must be retried.

---

#### **Example Use Case:**
A `Products` table has a `Version` column.

1. **Transaction 1: Reads the Record**
   ```sql
   SELECT ProductID, Stock, Version FROM Products WHERE ProductID = 1;
   ```
   - Reads the row with `Version = 5`.

2. **Transaction 2: Updates the Same Row**
   ```sql
   UPDATE Products
   SET Stock = Stock - 10, Version = Version + 1
   WHERE ProductID = 1 AND Version = 5;
   ```
   - Changes the version to `6`.

3. **Transaction 1: Tries to Update**
   ```sql
   UPDATE Products
   SET Stock = Stock - 5, Version = Version + 1
   WHERE ProductID = 1 AND Version = 5;
   ```
   - **Fails** because the version has changed to `6`.

4. **Transaction 1: Retries After Reading the Updated Data**
   ```sql
   SELECT ProductID, Stock, Version FROM Products WHERE ProductID = 1;
   ```
   - Retrieves the latest data and retries the operation.

---

#### **Advantages of Optimistic Locking:**
1. **High Concurrency:** No locks mean multiple transactions can proceed simultaneously.
2. **No Deadlocks:** Since no locks are held, circular waiting cannot occur.
3. Ideal for **low-contention systems**, such as:
   - Reporting or analytics systems.
   - Applications with a high volume of read operations and infrequent writes.

---

#### **Disadvantages of Optimistic Locking:**
1. **Retry Overhead:** Transactions may fail if there is a version mismatch, requiring retries.
2. **Conflict Detection Costs:** Managing and verifying version numbers adds computational overhead.
3. **Not Suitable for High Contention:** In systems with frequent data updates, retries may occur too often, reducing efficiency.

---

### **Key Differences Between Pessimistic and Optimistic Locking**

| **Feature**             | **Pessimistic Locking**                               | **Optimistic Locking**                               |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Conflict Handling**    | Prevents conflicts by locking data upfront.          | Detects conflicts during commit time.               |
| **Concurrency**          | Low concurrency due to locked data.                  | High concurrency as no locks are used.              |
| **Deadlocks**            | High risk of deadlocks due to locks.                 | No risk of deadlocks since no locks are used.       |
| **Performance**          | Slower due to blocking transactions.                 | Faster but may require retries.                     |
| **Overhead**             | Lock management adds overhead.                       | Version maintenance adds overhead.                  |
| **Use Cases**            | High-contention, write-heavy systems (e.g., banks).  | Low-contention, read-heavy systems (e.g., reports). |
| **Data Integrity**       | Ensures consistency upfront.                         | Relies on versioning to maintain consistency.        |

### **How to Choose Between Pessimistic and Optimistic Locking**

#### Use **Pessimistic Locking** When:
- **High contention** is expected, and conflicts are frequent.
- Data consistency is **critical**, and retries are not acceptable (e.g., money transfers).
- **Write-heavy systems** where simultaneous updates are common.

#### Use **Optimistic Locking** When:
- Conflicts are **rare**, and the system can tolerate retries.
- The application is **read-heavy** with occasional writes.
- **High performance and scalability** are priorities, such as in e-commerce or analytics systems.

---

### **Summary**
- **Pessimistic Locking:** Prevents conflicts by locking data but reduces performance and increases the risk of deadlocks. Suitable for environments with frequent updates and critical consistency requirements.
- **Optimistic Locking:** Detects conflicts later, offering better concurrency but requiring mechanisms to handle retries. Best suited for environments with low contention and high read activity.

Choosing the right strategy depends on the application’s needs, contention levels, and trade-offs between performance and data consistency.


## What is a two-phase commit? When would you use it?


A **two-phase commit (2PC)** is a distributed transaction protocol used to ensure **atomicity** across multiple databases or systems. It ensures that either all participants in a transaction commit the changes or none of them do, maintaining consistency even in distributed environments.

---

### **How Two-Phase Commit Works**

The two-phase commit protocol has two key phases: 

#### **Phase 1: Prepare Phase**
1. The **coordinator** (a central controlling entity) sends a **prepare message** to all participants (databases or nodes).
2. Each participant:
   - Executes the transaction locally, without committing the changes yet.
   - Checks whether it can successfully commit the changes (e.g., no errors, constraints satisfied).
   - Responds with either:
     - **Vote COMMIT**: Ready to commit.
     - **Vote ABORT**: Unable to commit (e.g., due to errors).

#### **Phase 2: Commit/Abort Phase**
1. The coordinator collects responses from all participants:
   - If **all participants vote COMMIT**, the coordinator sends a **COMMIT message** to all participants, and they commit the transaction.
   - If **any participant votes ABORT**, the coordinator sends an **ABORT message**, and all participants roll back their changes.
2. Each participant acknowledges the decision (commit or abort).

---

### **When to Use Two-Phase Commit**
The two-phase commit protocol is used in scenarios where a transaction spans multiple systems, and **consistency across systems is critical**. Typical use cases include:

1. **Distributed Databases**:
   - When a single transaction involves multiple databases (e.g., updating an order in one database and inventory in another).

2. **Microservices Architectures**:
   - When multiple microservices, each managing its own database, must coordinate a transaction (e.g., reserving a hotel room and booking a flight in a travel application).

3. **Cross-Data Center Transactions**:
   - When data updates span geographically distributed systems that need to remain consistent (e.g., global financial systems).

4. **Eventual Consistency with Atomicity Guarantees**:
   - When you need strong consistency between systems but still operate in a distributed environment.

---

### **Advantages of Two-Phase Commit**
1. **Consistency**:
   - Ensures all or none of the changes are applied across systems.
   
2. **Reliability**:
   - Prevents partial updates, which could leave systems in an inconsistent state.

3. **Compatibility**:
   - Supported by most relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle) and middleware systems (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).

---

### **Disadvantages of Two-Phase Commit**
1. **Blocking Nature**:
   - Participants remain locked (waiting for a decision) during the commit process, reducing performance.

2. **Single Point of Failure**:
   - If the coordinator crashes, participants may be left in an uncertain state.

3. **Latency**:
   - Increased transaction latency due to the multiple communication steps.

4. **Resource Intensive**:
   - Requires participants to maintain logs and locks for the duration of the protocol.

---

### **Alternatives to Two-Phase Commit**
If performance or availability is a concern, you might use other approaches:

1. **Eventual Consistency** (e.g., Saga Pattern):
   - Use compensating transactions to roll back changes in a distributed system if an error occurs.

2. **Consensus Algorithms** (e.g., Paxos, Raft):
   - Achieve agreement among distributed systems, often used for distributed databases like Cassandra or CockroachDB.

3. **Distributed Transactions with 3PC**:
   - A three-phase commit adds an extra phase to reduce blocking and uncertainty caused by coordinator failures.

---

### **Summary**
The two-phase commit protocol is ideal for systems where **strong consistency** across distributed components is non-negotiable, such as financial systems or inventory management. However, due to its performance overhead and blocking nature, it's not always the best choice for highly available or low-latency systems, where alternative patterns like eventual consistency or the Saga pattern might be more suitable.


Here’s an example of implementing a **two-phase commit** in a **NestJS application** using a relational database with TypeORM to demonstrate how you can handle distributed transactions.

---

### **Scenario**
Imagine you are building a banking application where a transaction needs to debit an amount from one account and credit it to another. These operations might span two separate services or databases, and you want to ensure that both succeed or neither is applied.

---

### **Code Example**

#### **1. Install Required Dependencies**
Ensure you have **TypeORM** and a database driver installed (e.g., PostgreSQL).

```bash
npm install @nestjs/typeorm typeorm pg
```

---

#### **2. Setup Database Entities**

##### **Account Entity**
Each account has an ID and a balance.

```typescript
// src/account.entity.ts
import { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column } from 'typeorm';

@Entity()
export class Account {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column({ type: 'decimal', precision: 10, scale: 2, default: 0 })
  balance: number;
}
```

---

#### **3. Implement Two-Phase Commit Logic**

##### **Service Layer**

```typescript
// src/transaction.service.ts
import { Injectable, InternalServerErrorException } from '@nestjs/common';
import { DataSource, QueryRunner } from 'typeorm';
import { Account } from './account.entity';

@Injectable()
export class TransactionService {
  constructor(private readonly dataSource: DataSource) {}

  async transferFunds(senderId: number, receiverId: number, amount: number): Promise<void> {
    // Create a query runner for managing the transaction
    const queryRunner: QueryRunner = this.dataSource.createQueryRunner();

    // Connect the query runner to the database
    await queryRunner.connect();

    // Start a transaction (Phase 1: Prepare Phase)
    await queryRunner.startTransaction();

    try {
      // Step 1: Debit sender's account
      const sender = await queryRunner.manager.findOne(Account, { where: { id: senderId } });
      if (!sender || sender.balance < amount) {
        throw new Error('Insufficient funds or sender not found');
      }
      sender.balance -= amount;
      await queryRunner.manager.save(sender);

      // Step 2: Credit receiver's account
      const receiver = await queryRunner.manager.findOne(Account, { where: { id: receiverId } });
      if (!receiver) {
        throw new Error('Receiver not found');
      }
      receiver.balance += amount;
      await queryRunner.manager.save(receiver);

      // If everything is successful, commit the transaction (Phase 2: Commit Phase)
      await queryRunner.commitTransaction();
    } catch (error) {
      // If any error occurs, rollback the transaction (Abort Phase)
      await queryRunner.rollbackTransaction();
      throw new InternalServerErrorException(error.message);
    } finally {
      // Release the query runner to free up resources
      await queryRunner.release();
    }
  }
}
```

---

#### **4. Create a Controller**

##### **Transaction Controller**
Expose an endpoint for the transaction.

```typescript
      // src/transaction.controller.ts
      import { Controller, Post, Body } from '@nestjs/common';
      import { TransactionService } from './transaction.service';
      
      @Controller('transactions')
      export class TransactionController {
        constructor(private readonly transactionService: TransactionService) {}
      
        @Post('transfer')
        async transferFunds(@Body() body: { senderId: number; receiverId: number; amount: number }) {
          const { senderId, receiverId, amount } = body;
      
          try {
            await this.transactionService.transferFunds(senderId, receiverId, amount);
            return {
              message: 'Transfer successful',
              senderId,
              receiverId,
              amount,
            };
          } catch (error) {
            return {
              message: 'Transfer failed',
              error: error.message,
            };
          }
        }
      }
```

## How would you handle **deadlocks** in a database?

### **Handling Deadlocks in a Database**

Handling deadlocks in a database is a critical aspect of ensuring system reliability and performance. Deadlocks occur when two or more transactions are waiting indefinitely for one another to release locks on resources, creating a cycle of dependencies that cannot be resolved. Below is a detailed explanation of how to handle deadlocks:

---

To effectively handle deadlocks, we can use **prevention**, **detection**, and **resolution** techniques.

### **1. Understanding Deadlocks**
A deadlock arises when the following four conditions (known as the Coffman conditions) are met:
1. **Mutual Exclusion**: Only one transaction can hold a lock on a resource at a time.
2. **Hold and Wait**: A transaction holds a lock on a resource while waiting for another resource.
3. **No Preemption**: A lock cannot be forcibly taken away from a transaction; it must be released voluntarily.
4. **Circular Wait**: A cycle of transactions exists where each transaction is waiting for a resource held by the next transaction in the cycle.

---

### **2. Deadlock Prevention**
Preventing deadlocks involves ensuring that at least one of the Coffman conditions cannot occur. Common strategies include:

### **a. Lock Ordering (Consistent Order of Resource Acquisition)**
- Ensure that transactions acquire locks in a consistent order.
- Example: If Transaction A needs to lock Table X and then Table Y, Transaction B must also lock Table X before Table Y.
- This prevents circular waits.

### **b. Timeout-Based Abort (Setting Lock Timeout)**
- Set a **lock timeout** so that a transaction will not wait indefinitely.
- Set a maximum time a transaction can wait for a lock. If the timeout is reached, the transaction is rolled back.
- This breaks the "hold and wait" condition.
- Example (PostgreSQL):
  
  ```sql
  
  SET lock_timeout = '5s';

  ```

- If a transaction cannot acquire a lock within 5 seconds, it aborts and retries.


#### **c. Preemption**
- Allow the database to forcibly revoke locks from one transaction to resolve a deadlock.
- This violates the "no preemption" condition.

#### **d. Wait-Die or Wound-Wait Schemes**

- **Wait-Die**: If a transaction requests a lock held by an older transaction, it waits. If the requesting transaction is older, it is aborted.
- **Wound-Wait**: If a transaction requests a lock held by a younger transaction, the younger transaction is aborted. If the requesting transaction is younger, it waits.
- These schemes prevent circular waits by prioritizing older transactions.

---

### **Avoid Long Transactions**
- Shorter transactions reduce the chance of deadlocks.
- Use **batch processing** instead of large, long-running transactions.

### ** Using Lower Isolation Levels (When Possible)**
- Higher isolation levels (e.g., **Serializable**) increase the chance of deadlocks.
- Instead, use **Read Committed** or **Repeatable Read** when possible.

---

## **2. Deadlock Detection**
If prevention is not feasible, databases must detect and resolve deadlocks.

#### **a. Wait-for Graph**
- A directed graph where nodes represent transactions, and edges represent dependencies (e.g., Transaction A is waiting for a lock held by Transaction B).
- The database periodically checks for cycles in the graph. If a cycle is found, a deadlock exists.

#### **b. Timeout Mechanisms**
- If a transaction waits too long for a lock, it is assumed to be part of a deadlock and is rolled back.

---

### **a. Deadlock Detection in Database Management Systems (DBMS)**
Most databases have built-in deadlock detection mechanisms:
- **PostgreSQL:** Uses a background process to detect circular waits.
- **MySQL (InnoDB):** Detects deadlocks when transactions wait for locks.
- **SQL Server:** Runs a deadlock monitor periodically.

### **b. Example: Checking for Deadlocks in MySQL**
You can use the following command to check deadlocks:
```sql
SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS;
```
This will output the latest deadlock details.

---

## **3. Deadlock Resolution**
Once a deadlock is detected, the DBMS automatically resolves it using **one of the following strategies**:

### **a. Transaction Rollback (Victim Selection)**
- The DBMS **selects one transaction** (usually the one with the least impact) and rolls it back.
- The aborted transaction can then retry.

### **b. Retrying the Transaction with Exponential Backoff**
- If a deadlock occurs, the application can **retry the transaction after a short delay**.
- Example in **Node.js with TypeORM**:
  ```typescript
  async function executeTransaction(entityManager) {
    const MAX_RETRIES = 3;
    let attempt = 0;

    while (attempt < MAX_RETRIES) {
      try {
        return await entityManager.transaction(async (transactionalEntityManager) => {
          // Perform operations
        });
      } catch (error) {
        if (error.message.includes('Deadlock')) {
          attempt++;
          await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, Math.pow(2, attempt) * 100)); // Exponential backoff
        } else {
          throw error;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- The **exponential backoff** reduces contention by delaying the retry.

### **c. Using Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)**
Instead of locking rows, use **version numbers** or timestamps:
- A transaction updates only if the record has not been modified by another transaction.
- Example (PostgreSQL):
  ```sql
  UPDATE employees 
  SET salary = salary + 1000 
  WHERE id = 1 AND last_updated = '2025-01-30T10:00:00';
  ```
- If `last_updated` has changed, the transaction is aborted and retried.

---


### **5. Best Practices to Minimize Deadlocks**
- **Keep Transactions Short**: Minimize the time locks are held by reducing transaction duration.
- **Access Resources in a Consistent Order**: Ensure all transactions access tables or rows in the same sequence.
- **Use Indexes**: Proper indexing reduces the likelihood of locking large portions of a table.
- **Limit Lock Granularity**: Use row-level locks instead of table-level locks where possible.
- **Monitor and Tune**: Regularly monitor the database for deadlocks and adjust application logic or database configuration as needed.

---

### **6. Database-Specific Mechanisms**
Different databases provide built-in mechanisms for handling deadlocks:
- **MySQL**: Automatically detects deadlocks and rolls back the transaction with the least impact.
- **PostgreSQL**: Uses a wait-for graph for detection and rolls back one of the involved transactions.
- **Oracle**: Employs a timeout-based mechanism and provides detailed deadlock information in trace files.
- **SQL Server**: Detects deadlocks using a dedicated monitor thread and provides deadlock graphs for analysis.

---

### **7. Application-Level Handling**
- **Retry Logic**: Implement retry logic in the application to handle deadlocks gracefully.
- **Error Handling**: Catch deadlock-related errors (e.g., `SQLSTATE 40001` in SQL for deadlocks) and retry the transaction.
- **Logging**: Log deadlock occurrences for analysis and optimization.

---

## **Conclusion**
To handle deadlocks effectively:
1. **Prevent them** using consistent locking order, timeouts, and shorter transactions.
2. **Detect them** using DBMS logs (`SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS`).
3. **Resolve them** by rolling back and retrying transactions with exponential backoff.


### **Conclusion**
Deadlocks are an inherent challenge in concurrent database systems, but they can be managed effectively through a combination of prevention, detection, and resolution strategies. By understanding the underlying causes and implementing best practices, you can minimize the occurrence of deadlocks and ensure the smooth operation of your database system.


## **Exponential Backoff: A Strategy for Handling Deadlocks and Retrying Transactions**  

#### **What is Exponential Backoff?**  
Exponential backoff is a strategy where, after a failure (such as a deadlock), the system **waits for an exponentially increasing amount of time** before retrying the operation. This reduces contention and improves overall system stability.

Instead of retrying immediately, we **increase the delay exponentially** (e.g., 100ms, 200ms, 400ms, 800ms, etc.) to avoid overwhelming the system.

---

### **How Exponential Backoff Works in Deadlock Handling**
1. A transaction tries to acquire a lock.
2. If a deadlock occurs, the DBMS **rolls back the transaction**.
3. Instead of retrying immediately, the transaction **waits for a random, exponentially increasing delay**.
4. The transaction retries up to a maximum number of attempts.

---

### **Example: Exponential Backoff in Node.js (TypeORM + PostgreSQL/MySQL)**  
This function **retries a transaction up to 5 times**, doubling the wait time after each failure:

```typescript
import { DataSource, EntityManager } from "typeorm";

async function executeWithExponentialBackoff(
  dataSource: DataSource,
  operation: (transactionalEntityManager: EntityManager) => Promise<void>,
  maxRetries: number = 5
) {
  let attempt = 0;

  while (attempt < maxRetries) {
    try {
      await dataSource.transaction(async (transactionalEntityManager) => {
        await operation(transactionalEntityManager);
      });
      return; // Success, exit the loop
    } catch (error) {
      if (error.message.includes("deadlock")) {
        attempt++;
        const delay = Math.pow(2, attempt) * 100 + Math.random() * 100; // Exponential backoff with jitter
        console.warn(`Deadlock detected. Retrying in ${delay}ms (attempt ${attempt}/${maxRetries})`);
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
      } else {
        throw error; // If it's not a deadlock, rethrow the error
      }
    }
  }

  throw new Error("Max retries reached. Transaction failed.");
}
```

---

### **Breaking Down the Code**
- The function **wraps the database operation** inside a transaction.
- If a **deadlock occurs**, it:
  - **Waits for an exponentially increasing delay** (`2^attempt * 100ms`).
  - **Adds jitter** (`+ Math.random() * 100ms`) to prevent synchronized retries.
  - **Retries the transaction**, up to `maxRetries` times.
- If the maximum number of retries is reached, it **throws an error**.

---

### **Why Use Exponential Backoff?**
✅ **Reduces database contention** (prevents simultaneous retries from causing new deadlocks).  
✅ **Increases chances of success** (waits for locks to be released).  
✅ **Prevents unnecessary failures** (retries intelligently instead of failing immediately).  



#### **Q1: What is a transaction in a database?**  
A **transaction** is a sequence of one or more database operations that are treated as a single unit of work. It follows the **ACID** properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).  

#### **Q2: Explain the ACID properties in a transaction.**  
- **Atomicity:** Ensures all operations in a transaction complete successfully or none at all.  
- **Consistency:** Ensures the database remains in a valid state before and after the transaction.  
- **Isolation:** Ensures transactions do not interfere with each other.  
- **Durability:** Ensures committed changes are permanently stored even after system failures.  

#### **Q3: What is the difference between COMMIT and ROLLBACK?**  
- **COMMIT**: Saves all changes made in the transaction permanently.  
- **ROLLBACK**: Reverts all changes made in the current transaction to the last committed state.  

---

### **Concurrency Control**  

#### **Q4: What is concurrency control in databases?**  
Concurrency control ensures multiple transactions execute **safely** and **correctly** when accessing shared data **simultaneously**. It prevents issues like dirty reads, lost updates, and deadlocks.

#### **Q5: What are isolation levels in SQL, and why are they important?**  
Isolation levels control how much one transaction **can see changes** made by other transactions.  

#### **What is Isolation in SQL?**  
Isolation is one of the four **ACID** properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) that ensure the integrity and consistency of a database during concurrent transactions. **Isolation** determines how visible the changes of one transaction are to other transactions before it is committed.

When multiple transactions run concurrently, they can lead to issues like **dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads**. **Isolation levels** define the degree to which one transaction is isolated from another to prevent these anomalies.

---

## **Types of Isolation Levels in SQL**  
SQL databases provide different **isolation levels** to control how transactions interact with each other. The standard **SQL isolation levels** are:

1. **Read Uncommitted**
2. **Read Committed**
3. **Repeatable Read**
4. **Serializable**

Each level provides a different balance between **concurrency** and **data consistency**.

---

## **1. Read Uncommitted (Lowest Isolation Level)**
### **Definition:**  
- A transaction can **read data** that another transaction has modified but not yet committed.
- This means you can **read uncommitted (dirty) data**.

### **Possible Issues (Anomalies):**
❌ **Dirty Read** – A transaction reads changes made by another transaction before it is committed. If the second transaction rolls back, the first transaction is left with incorrect data.

### **Example Scenario:**
1. **Transaction A** updates a product price but hasn’t committed the change.
   ```sql
   UPDATE Products SET Price = 500 WHERE ProductID = 1;
   ```
2. **Transaction B** reads the product price **before Transaction A commits or rolls back**.
   ```sql
   SELECT Price FROM Products WHERE ProductID = 1;
   ```
3. **If Transaction A rolls back**, Transaction B has already read incorrect data.

### **Use Cases:**  
✅ High-performance scenarios where data consistency is not critical, such as **log systems** or **temporary reporting dashboards**.

---

## **2. Read Committed (Default in Many Databases)**
### **Definition:**  
- A transaction can only read **committed** data.
- Uncommitted changes are **invisible** to other transactions.

### **Prevents:**
✅ **Dirty Reads** (Because it only reads committed data)

### **Possible Issues (Anomalies):**
❌ **Non-Repeatable Read** – A transaction reads the same row twice, but the data has changed in between because another transaction committed an update.

### **Example Scenario:**
1. **Transaction A** reads an employee’s salary.
   ```sql
   SELECT Salary FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = 101;
   ```
2. **Transaction B** updates the salary and commits it.
   ```sql
   UPDATE Employees SET Salary = 8000 WHERE EmployeeID = 101;
   COMMIT;
   ```
3. **Transaction A** reads the salary again and sees a different value.

### **Use Cases:**  
✅ Suitable for **most transactional applications**, such as banking and e-commerce, where **data consistency is required** but strict isolation is not needed.

---

## **3. Repeatable Read**
### **Definition:**  
- Ensures that if a transaction reads the same row multiple times, **the data remains the same** throughout the transaction.  
- **Prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads**.

### **Prevents:**  
✅ **Dirty Reads**  
✅ **Non-Repeatable Reads**

### **Possible Issues (Anomalies):**  
❌ **Phantom Reads** – If a transaction queries a range of rows, another transaction may insert a new row into that range, causing different results in subsequent queries.

### **Example Scenario:**
1. **Transaction A** reads all employees with a salary above 5000.
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary > 5000;
   ```
2. **Transaction B** inserts a new employee with Salary = 6000 and commits.
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name, Salary) VALUES (102, 'John', 6000);
   COMMIT;
   ```
3. **Transaction A** re-executes the same query and now sees a new employee (phantom read).

### **Use Cases:**  
✅ Used in **financial applications** where consistency of read operations is critical.  
✅ Suitable for scenarios where frequent updates happen on the same rows.

---

## **4. Serializable (Highest Isolation Level)**
### **Definition:**  
- **Strictest** isolation level that prevents **all anomalies** (dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads).  
- Transactions are executed **sequentially** (one after another), avoiding conflicts.  

### **Prevents:**  
✅ **Dirty Reads**  
✅ **Non-Repeatable Reads**  
✅ **Phantom Reads**  

### **Example Scenario:**
1. **Transaction A** starts and reads all orders from `Orders` table.
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Orders;
   ```
2. **Transaction B** attempts to insert a new order but is **blocked** until Transaction A is completed.
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO Orders (OrderID, Amount) VALUES (105, 1000);
   -- This operation will wait until Transaction A finishes.
   ```

### **Use Cases:**  
✅ **Critical applications like banking, financial transactions, and ledgers** where absolute consistency is required.  
✅ Suitable for **batch processing** but can **reduce performance** due to strict locking.

---

## **Comparison of SQL Isolation Levels**
| **Isolation Level**       | **Dirty Read** | **Non-Repeatable Read** | **Phantom Read** | **Performance Impact** |
|--------------------------|---------------|-------------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Read Uncommitted        | ✅ Yes        | ✅ Yes                  | ✅ Yes           | 🚀 Fastest (Least restrictive) |
| Read Committed          | ❌ No         | ✅ Yes                  | ✅ Yes           | ⚡ Fast, but some anomalies |
| Repeatable Read         | ❌ No         | ❌ No                   | ✅ Yes           | ⏳ Moderate |
| Serializable            | ❌ No         | ❌ No                   | ❌ No            | 🐢 Slowest (Most restrictive) |

---

## **Why Are Isolation Levels Important?**
1. **Ensuring Data Consistency** – Prevents anomalies when multiple users access the database.  
2. **Balancing Performance and Integrity** – Choosing the right isolation level avoids unnecessary blocking while maintaining consistency.  
3. **Avoiding Deadlocks and Lock Contention** – Higher isolation levels increase locking, which can lead to performance degradation.  
4. **Maintaining Business Logic Correctness** – Ensures critical transactions (e.g., money transfers) execute correctly.

---

## **How to Set Isolation Levels in SQL?**
Most databases allow you to set isolation levels using SQL commands.

### **Example in MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server**
```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Your queries here

COMMIT;
```

### **How to Set Isolation Level for a Specific Query**
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;

SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE OrderID = 101;

COMMIT;
```

## **Conclusion**
Isolation levels help **balance concurrency and consistency** in a database. **Choosing the right isolation level** depends on the specific use case:
- **Read Uncommitted**: High-speed, but risk of incorrect data.
- **Read Committed**: Default for most systems, prevents dirty reads.
- **Repeatable Read**: Ensures stability for repeated queries, but still allows phantom reads.
- **Serializable**: Guarantees **full consistency**, but may reduce system performance.


#### **Q6: What are dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads?**  
- **Dirty Read:** Transaction reads uncommitted data from another transaction.  
- **Non-Repeatable Read:** Data changes between two reads of the same row within a transaction.  
- **Phantom Read:** A transaction sees new rows added by another transaction.  

#### **Q7: How does optimistic locking differ from pessimistic locking?**  
- **Pessimistic Locking:** Locks data to prevent other transactions from modifying it (suitable for high-contention environments).  
- **Optimistic Locking:** Allows multiple transactions and only checks conflicts at commit time (better for read-heavy systems).
