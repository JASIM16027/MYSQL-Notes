### **Differences Between SQL and NoSQL Databases**

| **Aspect**              | **SQL Databases**                                                                                     | **NoSQL Databases**                                                                                  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Structure**           | Relational (Tables with rows and columns)                                                            | Non-relational (Documents, key-value pairs, wide-column stores, or graphs)                         |
| **Schema**              | Predefined, rigid schema (must define tables, columns, and data types before inserting data)         | Flexible schema (can store unstructured or semi-structured data)                                   |
| **Scalability**         | Vertically scalable (increase hardware resources like CPU/RAM of a single server)                    | Horizontally scalable (add more servers to the cluster for scaling out)                            |
| **Query Language**      | Uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for defining and manipulating data                              | Varies based on database type (e.g., MongoDB uses JSON-like queries, Cassandra uses CQL)           |
| **Transactions**        | Strong support for ACID transactions                                                                | Often uses BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency); limited ACID support      |
| **Performance**         | Performs well for complex queries and joins                                                          | Optimized for high read/write operations and large datasets with simple queries                    |
| **Use Cases**           | Suitable for applications with structured data and relationships                                     | Suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data, large-scale and distributed systems             |

### **When to Choose SQL vs NoSQL**

#### **When to Choose SQL:**
1. **Structured Data:**
   - Example: A banking application that requires predefined relationships between customers, accounts, and transactions.
   - SQL databases ensure strict data integrity and enforce relationships using **foreign keys**.

2. **Complex Queries:**
   - Example: Generating financial reports or analytics that require joining multiple tables.
   - SQL is ideal for handling **complex joins**, aggregations, and filters.

3. **ACID Compliance:**
   - Example: E-commerce systems where consistent transaction integrity (e.g., placing orders and reducing stock) is critical.
   - SQL databases guarantee atomic and reliable transactions.

4. **Small to Medium Dataset:**
   - Example: An HR management system with employee data stored on a single server.
   - SQL databases work well with vertically scalable architectures.

---

#### **When to Choose NoSQL:**
1. **Unstructured or Semi-Structured Data:**
   - Example: A content management system that stores blog posts, videos, and metadata.
   - NoSQL databases like MongoDB store data as flexible **JSON-like documents**.

2. **High Scalability Needs:**
   - Example: Social media platforms or messaging apps that need to handle millions of concurrent users.
   - NoSQL databases like Cassandra or DynamoDB are designed for **horizontal scaling**.

3. **Real-Time Analytics:**
   - Example: Tracking and analyzing user clicks, views, or engagement in real time.
   - Column-family stores like Apache HBase or wide-column stores like Cassandra excel in such use cases.

4. **Eventual Consistency Over Strict Transactions:**
   - Example: A distributed shopping cart system that syncs data across regions.
   - NoSQL databases prioritize availability and scalability over immediate consistency.

5. **Graph Relationships:**
   - Example: A recommendation engine (e.g., "People You May Know" in LinkedIn).
   - Graph databases like Neo4j handle **node-relationship models** more efficiently than relational databases.

---

### **Examples**

#### **SQL Example**:
**Use Case:** An employee database with structured data.
- Tables: `employees`, `departments`, `salaries`
- Schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  department_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(id)
);
```
**Query Example:**
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.name AS department
FROM employees
JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

#### **NoSQL Example**:
**Use Case:** A product catalog for an e-commerce platform.
- No fixed schema; each product can have different fields.
- MongoDB Document Example:
```json
{
  "_id": "123",
  "name": "Smartphone",
  "brand": "TechCo",
  "price": 799,
  "specifications": {
    "storage": "128GB",
    "color": "Black"
  }
}
```
**Query Example in MongoDB:**
```javascript
db.products.find({ brand: "TechCo", "specifications.color": "Black" });
```

---

### **Summary**
- **SQL** databases are best for structured, consistent, and relational data with a need for strong ACID compliance and complex queries.
- **NoSQL** databases excel for unstructured or semi-structured data, large-scale distributed systems, and use cases requiring high scalability or eventual consistency.





## Transaction States in DBMS
A transaction is a series of operations or tasks that work together to complete a specific process, which may involve changing data in a database. To handle issues like system failures, transactions go through different states.

A transaction state shows the current stage or condition of a transaction as it runs in the database. It tracks the progress and determines whether the transaction will finish successfully (commit) or stop due to an issue (abort).

## Different Types of Transaction States in DBMS

### Simplified Explanation of Transaction States

1. **Active State**  
   - The transaction starts, and its instructions (like insert, update, delete) are being executed.  
   - Changes are not yet saved to the database but kept temporarily in memory.

2. **Partially Committed**  
   - The transaction finishes all its operations but hasn't saved the changes permanently to the database yet.  
   - If successful, it moves to the "Committed" state; if something fails, it moves to the "Failed" state.

3. **Failed State**  
   - If an error occurs during the transaction, it stops, and the system ensures the database remains consistent.  
   - The database recovery system may attempt to fix the issue or terminate the transaction.

4. **Aborted State**  
   - If recovery from the failed state isn’t possible, the transaction is rolled back (undone) to restore the database to its original state.  
   - The transaction may either be canceled or restarted.

5. **Committed State**  
   - The transaction successfully saves its changes permanently to the database.  
   - This marks the completion of the transaction.

6. **Terminated State**  
   - After committing or rolling back, the transaction ends, and the system is ready for a new transaction.

---

### Example: Bank Transaction ($500 transfer from Account A to Account B)
1. **Active State:**  
   The transaction starts and reads Account A’s balance ($1000). It checks if there are sufficient funds.  

2. **Partially Committed:**  
   Deducts $500 from Account A ($1000 - $500 = $500) and temporarily updates Account B’s balance ($1500).

3. **Committed:**  
   Changes are saved permanently:  
   - Account A = $500  
   - Account B = $1500  

4. **Failed State:**  
   If something goes wrong (e.g., system crash), the transaction stops.  
   - Example: $500 is deducted from Account A but not added to Account B.

5. **Aborted State:**  
   The failed transaction is rolled back:  
   - Account A = $1000  
   - Account B = $1000  

6. **Terminated State:**  
   The transaction ends after committing or rolling back. The system is ready for a new transaction.  

This process ensures the database remains consistent, either completing the transaction fully or undoing changes in case of failure.



### What is Second Normal Form (2NF)?

Second Normal Form (2NF) is a step in database normalization that ensures the elimination of partial dependencies, which occur when non-key columns depend on only part of a composite primary key. 

To achieve 2NF, two rules must be satisfied:
1. **Be in 1NF**: The table must have a primary key, and all values must be atomic (no repeating groups or arrays).
2. **No Partial Dependencies**: All non-key columns must depend on the **entire primary key**, not just a part of it.

---

### Example of Moving to 2NF

#### 1NF Example: A Single Table

| MembershipID | MemberName | MovieRented | RentalDate |
|--------------|------------|-------------|------------|
| 101          | John Doe   | Matrix      | 2025-01-15 |
| 101          | John Doe   | Inception   | 2025-01-16 |
| 102          | Jane Roe   | Avatar      | 2025-01-15 |

- **Primary Key**: Composite key `(MembershipID, MovieRented)` uniquely identifies each row.
- Issue: Non-key column `MemberName` depends only on `MembershipID`, not the entire composite key. This is a **partial dependency**.

---

#### Why Is This Not in 2NF?

- `MemberName` depends **only on MembershipID** (part of the composite key).
- `MovieRented` and `RentalDate` depend on the entire composite key `(MembershipID, MovieRented)`.

This violates 2NF because not all non-key columns depend on the entire primary key.

---

#### Moving to 2NF: Splitting the Table

To remove the partial dependency, divide the table into two:

1. **Table 1: Members**
   | MembershipID | MemberName |
   |--------------|------------|
   | 101          | John Doe   |
   | 102          | Jane Roe   |

   - **Primary Key**: `MembershipID`
   - `MemberName` depends only on `MembershipID`.

2. **Table 2: Rentals**
   | MembershipID | MovieRented | RentalDate |
   |--------------|-------------|------------|
   | 101          | Matrix      | 2025-01-15 |
   | 101          | Inception   | 2025-01-16 |
   | 102          | Avatar      | 2025-01-15 |

   - **Primary Key**: Composite key `(MembershipID, MovieRented)`
   - `RentalDate` depends on the entire composite key.

---

### Foreign Key and Its Role

- In **Table 2**, `MembershipID` is now a **foreign key** that links back to **Table 1**.
- A **foreign key**:
  1. References the **primary key** of another table (here, `MembershipID` in **Table 1**).
  2. Helps establish relationships between tables (connects members to their rentals).
  3. Allows rows in one table to correspond to rows in another.

---

### Key Points About Foreign Keys
- A **foreign key** can have a name different from the primary key it references.
- **Foreign keys do not need to be unique**, as multiple rows in the child table can reference the same row in the parent table.
- Unlike primary keys, **foreign keys can contain NULL values**, meaning the reference can be optional.

---

### Benefits of 2NF and Foreign Keys
- Eliminates **partial dependencies**, reducing data redundancy.
- Organizes data into separate, related tables, improving database consistency.
- **Foreign keys** ensure relationships between tables remain valid, supporting data integrity.

### What is a Transitive Functional Dependency?

A **transitive functional dependency** happens when a non-key column in a database table indirectly depends on the primary key **through another non-key column**.

### Breaking It Down:

1. A **functional dependency** means one column's value determines another column's value.  
   Example: In a `Students` table, `StudentID → Name` means the `StudentID` determines the `Name`.

2. **Transitive dependency** means this happens indirectly.  
   - Column A (Primary Key) determines Column B.  
   - Column B determines Column C.  
   - Therefore, Column A indirectly determines Column C.  

This indirect dependency is a **transitive functional dependency**.

---

### Example:

Consider a `Students` table:

| StudentID | DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| 101       | D01          | Computer Science |
| 102       | D02          | Mathematics      |

- **Primary Key**: `StudentID`  
- **Functional Dependency**:  
  - `StudentID → DepartmentID` (StudentID determines DepartmentID).  
  - `DepartmentID → DepartmentName` (DepartmentID determines DepartmentName).  
  - So, `StudentID → DepartmentName` is a transitive dependency because `StudentID` indirectly determines `DepartmentName` through `DepartmentID`.

---

### Why Is This a Problem?
- Transitive dependencies can lead to **data redundancy** and **anomalies**.  
- Example: If the department name changes, you must update it everywhere it appears in the table.

---

### Solution:
- **Normalize the table** to eliminate transitive dependencies by creating separate tables for related data.  
- For the example, split the table into two:  
  1. **Students Table**: `StudentID`, `DepartmentID`  
  2. **Departments Table**: `DepartmentID`, `DepartmentName`  

This ensures data consistency and avoids redundancy.
