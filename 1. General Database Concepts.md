### **1. SQL Databases**

#### **Key Features**
- **Structured Data**: Data is stored in predefined rows and columns.
- **Relationships**: SQL databases enforce relationships through foreign keys.
- **Schema-Driven**: You must define the schema upfront, meaning you know the structure of the data ahead of time.
- **Strong Consistency (ACID)**: Transactions in SQL databases guarantee **Atomicity**, **Consistency**, **Isolation**, and **Durability**.

#### **Common Examples of SQL Databases**
- **MySQL**: Open-source, widely used for web applications.
- **PostgreSQL**: Supports advanced features like JSON, full-text search, and custom extensions.
- **Oracle Database**: Enterprise-grade SQL database with high scalability and support.
- **Microsoft SQL Server**: Microsoft’s robust relational database with integration into the .NET ecosystem.

#### **Example Scenario: Banking System**
A banking application requires:
1. Strict data integrity.
2. Complex relationships like customers, accounts, and transactions.
3. ACID-compliant transactions to ensure financial accuracy.

**Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  email VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE accounts (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INT,
  balance DECIMAL(10, 2),
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id)
);

CREATE TABLE transactions (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  account_id INT,
  amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
  type ENUM('debit', 'credit'),
  transaction_date DATETIME,
  FOREIGN KEY (account_id) REFERENCES accounts(id)
);
```

**SQL Query Example:**
```sql
SELECT c.name, a.balance, t.type, t.amount
FROM customers c
JOIN accounts a ON c.id = a.customer_id
JOIN transactions t ON a.id = t.account_id
WHERE c.id = 1;
```

---

### **2. NoSQL Databases**

#### **Key Features**
- **Flexible Schema**: Data can be added without strictly defined schemas, allowing for unstructured or semi-structured data.
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Data is distributed across multiple servers, making it ideal for handling massive workloads.
- **High Availability**: NoSQL databases prioritize availability (eventual consistency) in distributed systems.
- **Optimized for Specific Use Cases**:
  - Document Stores (e.g., MongoDB): JSON-like documents.
  - Key-Value Stores (e.g., Redis): Simple key-value pairs.
  - Column Stores (e.g., Cassandra): Data stored in columns for analytics.
  - Graph Databases (e.g., Neo4j): Nodes and edges for relationship-heavy use cases.

#### **Common Examples of NoSQL Databases**
- **MongoDB**: Flexible document-based database, great for dynamic schemas.
- **Cassandra**: Distributed database for high availability and scalability.
- **Redis**: In-memory key-value store for caching and real-time use cases.
- **Neo4j**: Optimized for graph-based data and relationship queries.

#### **Example Scenario: E-commerce Product Catalog**
An e-commerce platform needs:
1. Flexible product schemas (e.g., some products have different attributes like color, size, or specs).
2. High write-read throughput for handling customer searches and updates.

**MongoDB Document Example:**
```json
{
  "_id": "p123",
  "name": "Laptop",
  "brand": "TechBrand",
  "price": 1200,
  "specifications": {
    "CPU": "Intel i7",
    "RAM": "16GB",
    "Storage": "512GB SSD"
  },
  "categories": ["electronics", "laptops"],
  "ratings": {
    "average": 4.5,
    "reviews": 125
  }
}
```

**MongoDB Query Example:**
```javascript
// Find laptops by brand and filter by price
db.products.find({
  brand: "TechBrand",
  price: { $lt: 1500 }
});
```

### **3. ACID vs BASE**

To understand **ACID** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), let's break it down with a **real-world calculation example**: a bank fund transfer system where we transfer money between two accounts.

---

### **Scenario**: Transferring $100 from Account A to Account B

- **Initial Balances**:
  - Account A: $500
  - Account B: $300

- **Goal**:
  Transfer $100 from Account A to Account B.

---

### **1. Atomicity**

Atomicity ensures that a transaction is **all or nothing**. Either both the debit and credit operations happen, or neither happens.

#### Steps:
- Debit $100 from Account A → $500 - $100 = $400
- Credit $100 to Account B → $300 + $100 = $400

#### What Happens If Atomicity Fails?
- Debit occurs, but credit fails (e.g., system crash after debiting Account A):
  - Account A: $400
  - Account B: $300
  - Total: $700 (Incorrect!)
  
  Atomicity ensures that **both operations succeed or none are applied**, maintaining the integrity of the transaction.

---

### **2. Consistency**

Consistency ensures that the **database remains in a valid state** before and after the transaction, adhering to predefined rules.

#### Rules:
- Total money in the system must remain the same.
- Before: $500 (A) + $300 (B) = $800
- After: $400 (A) + $400 (B) = $800 (Valid!)

#### What Happens If Consistency Fails?
- If $100 is debited from Account A but not credited to Account B:
  - Account A: $400
  - Account B: $300
  - Total: $700 (Violates consistency!)

Consistency ensures the system remains **logically correct** after every transaction.

---

### **3. Isolation**

Isolation ensures that **concurrent transactions do not interfere** with each other. Let's say:

#### Two Transactions Run Simultaneously:
1. **T1**: Transfer $100 from A to B
2. **T2**: Transfer $200 from A to C

- Without Isolation:
  - T1 debits $100 from A (new balance $400).
  - T2 reads the outdated balance of $500 and debits $200 → Result: $300 in Account A.
  - Total debits: $300 instead of $100 + $200 = $300. This is **wrong**.

- With Isolation:
  - T1 completes first:
    - Account A: $400
  - Then T2 starts:
    - Account A: $400 - $200 = $200
  - Correct result.

Isolation ensures transactions are processed **serially or in a way that doesn’t conflict**.

---

### **4. Durability**

Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, its changes are **permanent**, even in case of system failure.

#### Steps:
1. Debit $100 from A.
2. Credit $100 to B.
3. Commit the transaction.

- What Happens If Durability Fails?
  - The system crashes after committing the transaction.
  - On recovery:
    - Account A: $400
    - Account B: $400
    - Durability ensures these changes are saved to disk and remain intact.

If durability is not ensured, data may revert to the previous state ($500 and $300), losing the transaction.

---

### Code Example: ACID in Action with TypeORM

Here’s how ACID principles apply in a Node.js app using TypeORM:

```typescript
import { AppDataSource } from './data-source';

async function transferFunds(senderId: number, receiverId: number, amount: number) {
  const queryRunner = AppDataSource.createQueryRunner();
  await queryRunner.connect();
  await queryRunner.startTransaction();

  try {
    // Atomicity: Both debit and credit must succeed
    const sender = await queryRunner.manager.findOne('Account', { where: { id: senderId } });
    const receiver = await queryRunner.manager.findOne('Account', { where: { id: receiverId } });

    if (!sender || !receiver) throw new Error('Account not found');
    if (sender.balance < amount) throw new Error('Insufficient funds');

    // Debit sender
    sender.balance -= amount;
    await queryRunner.manager.save(sender);

    // Credit receiver
    receiver.balance += amount;
    await queryRunner.manager.save(receiver);

    // Commit transaction
    await queryRunner.commitTransaction(); // Ensures Durability
    console.log('Transaction successful');
  } catch (error) {
    // Rollback if any operation fails (Atomicity)
    await queryRunner.rollbackTransaction();
    console.error('Transaction failed:', error.message);
  } finally {
    await queryRunner.release(); // Ensures proper cleanup
  }
}

transferFunds(1, 2, 100);
```

---

### Explanation of Code:

1. **Atomicity**: 
   - Debit and credit are executed within a single transaction.
   - If one fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.

2. **Consistency**:
   - Ensures the total balance across accounts remains unchanged.

3. **Isolation**:
   - The transaction runs in isolation using the query runner, avoiding interference with other transactions.

4. **Durability**:
   - Once the transaction commits, changes are persisted to the database, even if the application crashes afterward.

| **Feature**               | **SQL (ACID)**                                                                                          | **NoSQL (BASE)**                                                                                         |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Atomicity**             | Ensures all steps in a transaction are completed; if not, none are executed.                           | Transactions may be incomplete; eventual consistency is prioritized.                                   |
| **Consistency**           | Ensures the database remains in a valid state after a transaction.                                     | Data may temporarily violate consistency but becomes consistent over time.                             |
| **Isolation**             | Transactions do not interfere with one another.                                                       | High availability is prioritized over isolation.                                                       |
| **Durability**            | Changes persist, even in case of failure.                                                             | Durability may depend on replication and backups rather than immediate writes.                         |
| **Performance**           | More predictable but can be slower due to transaction overhead.                                       | Optimized for performance, especially in distributed environments.                                     |

| **Schema**              | Predefined, rigid schema (must define tables, columns, and data types before inserting data)         | Flexible schema (can store unstructured or semi-structured data)                                   |
| **Scalability**         | Vertically scalable (increase hardware resources like CPU/RAM of a single server)                    | Horizontally scalable (add more servers to the cluster for scaling out)                            |
| **Query Language**      | Uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for defining and manipulating data                              | Varies based on database type (e.g., MongoDB uses JSON-like queries, Cassandra uses CQL)           |
| **Transactions**        | Strong support for ACID transactions                                                                | Often uses BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency); limited ACID support      |

### **5. Scalability & Performance**

| **Feature**              | **SQL**                                                                                               | **NoSQL**                                                                                              |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scaling**              | Vertical scaling (upgrading server resources like RAM/CPU).                                          | Horizontal scaling (adding nodes to distribute load).                                                 |
| **Write Performance**    | Slower for large-scale writes due to transaction overhead.                                            | Optimized for high write workloads (e.g., time-series data in Cassandra).                             |
| **Read Performance**     | Excellent for structured data with indexes and joins.                                                | Excellent for distributed queries or key-based lookups.                                               |

### **6. Example Real-World Applications**
#### **SQL Example: Uber Rides**
Uber uses PostgreSQL for relational data like:
- User profiles.
- Payment details.
- Trip records with precise consistency needs.

#### **NoSQL Example: Netflix Streaming**
Netflix uses Cassandra for:
- Tracking real-time data (e.g., user views, recommendations).
- Storing billions of events per day, where eventual consistency is acceptable.

---

### **Conclusion**
- Choose **SQL** when your application needs structured data, strong consistency, and complex queries.
- Choose **NoSQL** when you need flexibility, high scalability, and high availability, particularly for unstructured or distributed systems.
